## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-preprocessing-ml.git

Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
First, ensure you have completed the installation steps.

Run the data preprocessing script:

bash
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
This script loads a dataset, handles missing values, removes duplicates, and identifies and removes outliers. The cleaned data is used to train a machine learning model.

Train the machine learning model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
The model is trained and evaluated, and the results are displayed.

Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is available at [insert data source link]. You can download the dataset from there and place it in the project directory as dataset.csv.

Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing script, data_preprocessing.py, performs the following steps:

Loads the dataset from dataset.csv.
Checks for missing values and fills them with the mean.
Removes duplicate rows.
Identifies and removes outliers using Z-scores.
Prepares the data for training.
Results and Outputs
After running the train_model.py script, you will see the following results:

Model accuracy
Model precision
Model recall
Model F1 score
ROC-AUC score
